#### Learning Objective

Learn how to create basic association rules for 2 product basket and assess the strenght of the rule using support, confidence, and lift.

#### Context

While uncovering the products that customers tend to purchase together (i.e. the baskets), we need metrics to help quantify the strength of this association. How can we tell if someone who purchases product A is also likely to purchase product B? By looking at the support, confidence, and lift of a particular product combination (i.e. an association rule), we can understand how likely it for customers to purchase these items, how often customers who purchase A also purchase B, and whether or not customers tend to purchase B only when purchasing A.

#### Steps to be executed by the student (max 6)


- Step 1) In the Product Catalog, select the product with ID-NAME combination "3882 - WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER". Observe the product purchases and basket purchases table.
- Step 2) In the Antecedent set, select the product with ID-NAME combination "3882 - WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER" 
- Step 3) In the Consequent set, select the product with ID-NAME combination "3948 - WOODEN PICTURE FRAME WHITE FINISH" 

#### Exercise question:

What's the lift of the rule "3882 - WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER" -> "3948 - WOODEN PICTURE FRAME WHITE FINISH"

#### Explanation & Description
The learner will understand how to manually construct association rules, and how to evaluate association rules using support, confidence and lift. This is a key learning objective as understanding how to use these metrics is critical to analyzing whether an association rule suggests a potentially profitable product combination or not.
